        Freedom Recovery is an addiction treatment program for those suffering from alcohol abuse disorder or the addiction to drugs.
        It is a remote-only, open forum, intended to foster communication in a healthy and judgment-free way. In a Freedom Recovery meeting, depending on the specific meeting group, we will cover one or more of the following topics. We will use the term "addiction" often in the program as an umbrella term for the addiction to both drugs and alcohol. Many of the existing recovery support programs are outdated. They use an archaic approach, materials, and resources. It's no longer the 1900's and it's time for a new generation of addiction recovery support!
